# POI Expansion System Requirements
# Production-ready Python packages for POI database expansion

# Core functionality - no external dependencies required
# The system is designed to work with Python standard library only

# Optional testing and development dependencies (install separately if needed):
# pytest>=7.0.0
# pytest-cov>=4.0.0
# pytest-mock>=3.0.0
# coverage>=6.0

# Optional performance monitoring (install separately if needed):
# memory-profiler>=0.60.0
# psutil>=5.8.0

# The POI expansion system is designed to be dependency-free for production use.
# All functionality is implemented using Python standard library modules:
#
# - json: POI data serialization
# - pathlib: File system operations  
# - logging: Structured logging
# - hashlib: Backup integrity verification
# - zipfile: Backup compression
# - unittest: Testing framework
# - argparse: CLI interface
# - tempfile: Testing utilities
# - datetime: Timestamp handling
# - dataclasses: Data structures (Python 3.7+)
# - typing: Type annotations (Python 3.5+)
# - abc: Abstract base classes
# - enum: Enumeration types

# Minimum Python version: 3.7
# Recommended Python version: 3.9+
# Tested on: Windows 10/11, Python 3.9-3.11
