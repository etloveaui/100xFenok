# Update Manifest — Automatic manifest.json sync
#
# Triggered whenever any file under data/ is pushed to main.
# Updates file_count and updated fields for changed folders.
#
# Infinite loop prevention:
#   This workflow's own commit uses "[skip ci]" → GitHub Actions skips it.
#
# What is updated:  file_count, updated, last_updated
# What is NOT touched: version, update_frequency, source, description, recent_changes
